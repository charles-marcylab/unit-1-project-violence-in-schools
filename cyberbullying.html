            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Approximately 160,000 teens have skipped school because of bullying.</li>
                <li>In the US, 1 in 5 students ages 12-18 has been bullied during the school year.</li>
                <li>Students who reported that they were frequently bullied scored lower in reading, mathematics, and science than their peers who reported that they were never or rarely bullied.</li>
                <li>42% percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that the bullying was related to at least one of the following characteristics: physical appearance (30%), race (10%), gender (8%), disability (7%), ethnicity (7%),
                    religion (5%), and sexual orientation (4%).</li>

            <p class="para1">.Just as young people used to spend unmonitored time playing with friends in the neighborhood, outside the periphery of adults, they are now engaging with each other in the cyberworld, talking with each other, talking to each other, and talking about each other, often without adult or parental monitoring. While technology allows young people to connect in meaningful ways, such as the opportunity to share ideas, photos, videos, and more, the unsupervised nature of the cyberworld demands the need for guidance, guidelines, and social responsibility..</p>
            
            
            
            <p> Cyberbullying can happen anywhere there is online social interaction. For example, some young people use social media, video games, texting, or anonymous apps to bully other youth, post embarrassing pictures, share private information, or send threatening messages. Students can use their access to a large online audience to encourage their peers to join them in targeting someone with gossip, rumors, and untrue stories.</p>
