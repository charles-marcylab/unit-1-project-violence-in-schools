                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Approximately 160,000 teens have skipped school because of bullying.</li>
                    <li>In the US, 1 in 5 students ages 12-18 has been bullied during the school year.</li>
                    <li>Students who reported that they were frequently bullied scored lower in reading, mathematics, and science than their peers who reported that they were never or rarely bullied.</li>
                    <li>42% percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that the bullying was related to at least one of the following characteristics: physical appearance (30%), race (10%), gender (8%), disability (7%), ethnicity (7%), religion (5%), and sexual orientation (4%).</li>

                <p class="para1">At least 20% of all students in NYC public schools have reported some type of bullying or abusive behavior from their peers. Studies have shown that young students who bully others are at increased risk for substance abuse academic problems, and prone to violence later in their adolescence and adulthood. Youth who harass or mistreat others and are bullied themselves suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for mental health issues and behavioral problems. Since student bystanders can often intervene most effectively, it’s important for schools to encourage bystander intervention by teaching skills and offering resources that support this behavior. Schools should also seek to ensure that bystanders are protected and students know not to put themselves in danger.</p>
